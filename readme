SelfProjector.pde is the processing code which does all the capture and display work. It is dependent on:

* the Shiffman Kinect library
* the Peasycam library
* the org.processing.wiki library

so make sure you have these installed and recognised by Processing before you get started.

Kinect2RhinoFilter.gh is a Grasshopper for Rhino filter and reads CSV files output by SelfProjector. It allows you to filter the number of points, adapt the depth mapping etc.
